	<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="TextArticle1" -->
	<p class="texto_info" style="text-align: left;">As much of the world practices social distancing to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the workforce is being split into nonessential workers, those who should stay home to flatten the curve, and essential workers, those on whom we rely for our basic needs. While it seems obvious that major clothing outlets fit into the nonessential category, many fast fashion brands (including H&M and Zara) were still open for the majority of March, as the pandemic spread across the globe. Retail workers were on the front lines of a global crisis in the middle of growing confirmed numbers of cases. Now, they are facing mass layoffs.<br><br>While brands like Zara have said that they’re joining in the fight against the coronavirus, Aja Barber says action should be taken to support the health and safety of their workers. “They [all major fast fashion brands] could just not make their employees work during a deadly pandemic. If you’re really interested in fighting COVID-19, that’s an obvious and very easy way.”</p>

	  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="TextArticle2" -->
	  <p class="texto_info" style="text-align: left;">Aja hopes that shedding a light on retail employees’ working conditions during the pandemic, through her Instagram, will force people to be more critical of the entire fast fashion system. “If a business is willing to risk your life and you don’t like it, why aren’t we all looking out for supply chain workers who deal with the life-risking situations every day?"<br><br>In addition to impacted retail workers, the pandemic has sent shockwaves through the most vulnerable workers in fashion’s supply chain. Those 40 million garment workers, many of whom are living in low-wage countries across Southeast Asia and Europe, are currently facing factory closures. Already, more than 1 million garment workers in Bangladesh have been fired or furloughed (temporarily suspended from work) because of the cancellations.</p>

	  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="TextArticle3" -->
	  <p class="texto_info" style="text-align: left;">Céline Semaan views the recent treatment of retail workers as a curtain that has been lifted. “The realities of fast fashion have entered the mainstream culture. Exploitation of labor is not only seen abroad, but is something that has been exposed right here in America,” she says. “This pandemic is putting the entire fashion industry on hold while placing an incredible amount of economic pressure on ethical brands and independent designers. It is breaking the model of fast fashion: overproduction and overconsumption.”<br><br>Within the uncertainty and destruction of current daily lives comes both a responsibility and opportunity for the fashion industry to prioritize labor rights, from retail workers through the supply chain. For brands that don't, Aja warns that there will no longer be room for them in the near future. “The future looks like smaller profit margins for fast fashion. No two ways about it,” she explains. “We need ethical and sustainable companies, and right now not a single fast fashion brand is doing that. Shape up or ship out.”</p>
